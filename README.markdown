Firescrape is a plugin for Firebug (which is itself a Firefox plugin)
for developing screen scrapers.

It is currently in early development, though a very useful feature is
already present:

In Firebug's HTML tab, right click a DOM node and select "Mark
Contaianer Element".  Now right click another node and click "Copy
relative XPath" to copy the xpath from the container node to the
second node to the clipboard.  Note that the xpath may be useful
verbatim, but generally it will be overly constrained and you might
want to play around with it.
